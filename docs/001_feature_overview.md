Dockyard fits perfectly for sharing documentation. Whether it is sharing with your customers or within you team. 
The endgoal is to build a packing standard for sharing project/product documentation with vendors, customers, users etc,
possibly embedded with the project/product.
Prerequisites for using dockyard is markdown's understanding and some hacks described in [Quickstart](#quickstart) and [Detailed Overview](#detailed_overview).
